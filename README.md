# JakeDerkowski96's Resume

Created this resume with the help of [posquit0](#https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) repository that *clearly* organizes content into manageable sections and also allows for easy personal tweaks.

## My repository 

Uses bash scripts to automate the organization and version history of each resume by date. In earlier directories you will see resumes targeting various positions which were all compiled together, at the same time running *./compile.sh*. This script is to be modified for ones particular needs.

### Sections/Content

Each section has its own *.tex* file in the *content* directory. To add, remove, or reorder these sections, do so within the *resume.tex* or *cv.tex* files outside of the content directory. These files fornmat and personalize the resume for you.
